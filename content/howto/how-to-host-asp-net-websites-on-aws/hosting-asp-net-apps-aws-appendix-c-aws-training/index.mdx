I didn't know all this a few months ago. I did try to understand AWS, all their services and which ones I needed, but it was just too much. In the end I took a few of [their free](https://aws.amazon.com/training/) [](https://aws.amazon.com/training/) [online courses](https://aws.amazon.com/training/) to get a basic understanding of the AWS architecture and services. If you're also starting with AWS I'd recommend to start with these two courses:

- [AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials](https://www.aws.training/Details/Curriculum?id=27076)
- [AWS Security Fundamentals](https://www.aws.training/Details/eLearning?id=34259)

If you want to dig in a little deeper and want to experiment with container, have a look at these:

- [Introduction to Containers](https://www.aws.training/Details/eLearning?id=27182)
- [Introduction to Amazon Elastic Container Service](https://www.aws.training/Details/Video?id=16444)
- [Introduction to Amazon Elastic Container Registry](https://www.aws.training/Details/Video?id=15876)
- [Introduction to AWS Fargate](https://www.aws.training/Details/Video?id=16623)
- [Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) Primer](https://www.aws.training/Details/eLearning?id=30260)

I also watched and skimmed two YouTube courses on AWS on the [freecodecamp YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ/videos). They give a very basic overview of all the services, but it's enough to get you started.

- [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Training 2020 - Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hLmDS179YE)
- [AWS Certified Solutions Architect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia-UEYYR44s)

Al of these courses are really basic. What I really miss are in-depth courses, where they really tell you why you should use one setting over another. I guess in the end you just have to start and experiment yourself. That's what I did with [jodiBooks](https://jodibooks.com) and which resulted in this tutorial.
