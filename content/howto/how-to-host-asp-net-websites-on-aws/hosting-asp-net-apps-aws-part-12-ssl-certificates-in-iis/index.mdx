## Certify SSL Manager

To enable https connections to our websites we need an SSL certificate. You can buy certificates through specialized companies: Certificate Authorities. Getting a fully validated business wildcard certificate will set you back hundreds or thousands of dollars.

We're running on the cheap, and without a load balancer we cannot get a free SSL certificate through AWS.

> Public SSL/TLS certificates provisioned through AWS Certificate Manager are free. You pay only for the AWS resources you create to run your application.

We need to generate them manually through Let's Encrypt. I found an application that does make creating certificates really easy.

1. Go to [https://certifytheweb.com/](https://certifytheweb.com/) and download the Certify SSL Manager.
2. Run the installer and install.
3. When you first open the program you're asked to fill in some basic information, like your name and contact information.
4. Click the **New Certificate** button in the top left corner of the screen. Give you certificate a name. We'll take `*.jodibooks.nl` for this example. The asterisk shows us it's a wildcard certificate.  
    In the _Add domains to certificate_ box type `jodibooks.nl` and **add domains**, followed by `*.jodibooks.nl` and **add domains**. The program will show a notification we have to use DNS to verify the domain, **OK**. Lastly choose your preferred domain to show on the certificate.

5. Go to the IAM console in AWS. Go to users and **Add user.** Add the user name **`ACME-DNS`** with _Access type_ **Programmatic access**.

[![add acme-dns iam user](images/ssl-02-1024x554.png)](https://blog.jodibooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ssl-02.png)

6. In the next step click **Attach existing policies directly** and search for `Route53FullAccess`. Select it and click **Next**.

[![add route53 policy](images/ssl-03-1024x554.png)](https://blog.jodibooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ssl-03.png)

7. Press **Next** again after adding optional tags and clikc **Create user**.

[![create acme-dns iam user](images/ssl-04-1024x554.png)](https://blog.jodibooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ssl-04.png)

8. Save the credentials and leave the browser tab open for a moment.
9. Go back to Certify and go to **Authorization** on the right. Change the _Challenge Type_ to `dns-01` and the _DNS Update Method_ to `Amazon Route 53 DNS API`.

[![add domain authorization settings](images/ssl-05-1024x640.png)](https://blog.jodibooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ssl-05.png)

I already had a IAM user `ACME-DNS`. See next step how to add a new user.

10. Now add **new** credentials and enter the _Credential name_ `ACME-DNS-EXAMPLE` or just `ACME-DNS` and the credentials you just made.

[![enter route53 credentials](images/ssl-06-1024x616.png)](https://blog.jodibooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ssl-06.png)

11. Click the 3 dots **...** and choose the hosted zone. In my case `jodibooks.nl.`
12. Click the **Test** button in the top-right of the window. Certify will start testing if it can add the necessary DNS records in Route 53.

[![route53 dns test successful](images/ssl-07-1024x616.png)](https://blog.jodibooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ssl-07.png)

13. Close the _Test Progress_and go to **Other Options** in the right menu. I increased the _CSR Signing Algorithm_ to ECDSA P-256. The higher the more secure, but probably also more CPU intensive. Press the **Request Certificate** button.

[![increase signing algorithm strenght](images/ssl-08-1024x616.png)](https://blog.jodibooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ssl-08.png)

14. Certify goes to work. It can take a while, as the DNS records need to be propagated. Just be patience and a few minutes later you have a wildcard certificate. Note that it will expire in 89 days, but that _auto renewal_ is _enabled_.

## HSTS in IIS

Certify will have automatically created https-bindings to all your website in IIS with the `*.jodibooks.nl` domain. What IIS doesn't do yet is redirect users from http to a secured https connection. That we have to configure with HSTS.

1. Open IIS Manager and select your website. Now all the way on the right, near the bottom there is a link to **HSTS...** Scan for the _Configure_ heading to find it.

[![find the HSTS link in IIS](images/ssl-10-1024x616.png)](https://blog.jodibooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ssl-10.png)

2. **Enable** it obviously, set a _Max-Age_ to at least `10368000` seconds (120 days) and ideally to `31536000` (one year). Now also enable the other options: **IncludeSubDomains**, **Preload** and **Redirect Http to Https**. Repeat for all your websites.

## Next: WordPress

With that our ASP.NET websites are running. In the [next part](../hosting-asp-net-apps-aws-part-13-wordpress-hosting-on-lemp-ssl-s3/) a bonus feature: a WordPress blog on a super fast Ubuntu LEMP stack.
