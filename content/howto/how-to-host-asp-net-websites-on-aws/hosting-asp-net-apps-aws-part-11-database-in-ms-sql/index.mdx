For our application we chose to use the Microsoft SQL server engine. The reason? Well, Microsoft is very good at nudging developers using Visual Studio to choose MS SQL server. For small databases that is fine. The Express edition is free and has sufficient capacity.

As we have chosen an EC2 instance with limited memory, we have noticed some memory issues. The SQL engine is constantly using 10-20% CPU which seems to be [related to insufficient memory](https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/157226/ms-sql-server-2016-constant-cpu-usage-of-10-all-db-offline). And after importing a database the instance is almost unusable while creating the indexes, which takes up 45 minutes to an hour.

To limit the issues as much as possible we have to run as little programs as possible. A better solution would be to move the database to a separate instance, but that will cost extra money. We will be moving to a MySQL/Aurora/MariaDB solution soon though, more on that in [appendix E](../hosting-asp-net-apps-aws-appendix-e-improved-architectures/).

### SSMS

An easy way to manage the database is through SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio). It is installed by default in the AMI by AWS that we installed. It does however takes memory to run.

Luckily the SQL Server engine can also be accessed remotely, so we'll delete the SQL Server Management Studio on our EC2 instance and install it on a local machine instead.

Before we do that we are going to use it one last time to add a remote user.

1. Login to the EC2 instance through remote desktop. Open SSMS and connect to the Database Engine. The _Server name_ should be `<computername>\SQLEXPRESS` and _Authentication_ `Windows Authentication`.

[![connect to the database engine through remote desktop](images/mssql-01-1024x616.png)](https://blog.jodibooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/mssql-01.png)

2. **Right-click** the server engine _(server name\\SQLEXPRESS (SQL...)_ and click **Properties**.

[![go to properties of database engine](images/mssql-02-1024x616.png)](https://blog.jodibooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/mssql-02.png)

3. Click **Security** and select **SQL Server and Windows Authentication mode**. Press **OK**.

[![select server authentication mode](images/mssql-03-1024x616.png)](https://blog.jodibooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/mssql-03.png)

4. Now expand **Security -> Logins**, **Right-click** the **sa** user and click **Properties**.

[![open sa user properties](images/mssql-04-1024x616.png)](https://blog.jodibooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/mssql-04.png)

5. In the **General** page enter a **password** and **confirm** it. Now go to the **Status** page and set _Login:_ to **Enabled**. Click **OK**.

[![system admin user settings](images/mssql-05-1024x464.png)](https://blog.jodibooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/mssql-05.png)

6. We already opened the firewall port `1433` during setup of the EC2 in [part 5](../hosting-asp-net-apps-on-aws-part-5-ec2-instances/). There we also already attached a security group `sg-ms-sql`.
    1. Open SSMS on your local machine and enter your _**domain**_ (awesome!) or the _**Public DNS**_ as _Server name_. Select **SQL Server Authentication** and enter the login credentials: _Login:_ **sa**, _Password:_ **as entered in step 5**. You can only login from your office/home IP.

8. When successful, uninstall SSMS from the EC2 instance.

## Memory

A [possible cause](https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/157226/ms-sql-server-2016-constant-cpu-usage-of-10-all-db-offline) of the constant CPU use could be the high amount of memory utilization. It is above 90% most of the time so possibly the SQL server is trying to scrap together memory and over eagerly busy with garbage collection (or something, I have no idea what it is doing).

We can however limit the amount of (reserved) memory the SQL server is controlling. This should in theory stop the server from trying to clean up unnecessary amounts of memory. This kind of works, but obviously limits the performance when the database grows.

1. **Right-click** the database server and click **Properties**.

[![go to SQL server properties](images/mssql-07-1024x616.png)](https://blog.jodibooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/mssql-07.png)

2. Got to the **Memory** page and set the _Maximum server memory_ to `512` MB. This is by no means a well researched limit. It's my initial guess and it seems to work for our single database which is currently ~90 MB, which has a memory consumption of ~105 MB. Please do consult a database expert and/or Google and run your own tests.

## Transfer the database

Alright, our database server is setup so we can finally import the actual database. I'll assume you already have a database running for development or in another production environment and that you're using a similar SQL server version. Let's first export a database and then import it.

### Export

1. Open SSMS and connect to your development database server. Now **Right-click** the database you want to export, go to **Tasks** and click **Back up...**.

[![find back up task in databasemenu](images/mssql-09-1024x616.png)](https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/jodibooks-public-cdn/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/18150617/mssql-09.png)

2. Check if the correct _Database_ is selected `<database>`. Select _Backup type:_ `Full` and under _Destination_ select _Back up to_ `Disk`.

[![select database export parameters](images/mssql-10-1024x616.png)](https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/jodibooks-public-cdn/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/18151712/mssql-10.png)

3. Now click **Add...** and browse to the folder you want to "dump" the backup to (annoyingly you can't select all folders, we'll fix that in the next step). Select `All files(*)` for _Files of type_ and enter a filename like `<database>-export`. Click **OK**.

[![select base folder and filename for export](images/mssql-11-1024x616.png)](https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/jodibooks-public-cdn/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/18152016/mssql-11.png)

4. Now click **OK** twice and the database will be exported.

[![backup destination selected](images/mssql-12-1024x616.png)](https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/jodibooks-public-cdn/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/18153122/mssql-12.png)

5. If you get an error, try this solution:

Error resolved by granting permission to backup/export folder to MSSQL$SQLEXPRESS user

6. Download the database export, the "dump", to your computer.

### Import

1. Copy the database dump to the EC2. Copy it and paste it in a folder through the remote desktop connection.
2. **Right-click** the **Database** folder in the _Object Explorer_ and click **Restore Database...**.

[![find restore database in menu](images/mssql-15-1024x615.png)](https://blog.jodibooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/mssql-15.png)

3. Select **Device** and click the "3 dots" **...** In the next screen click **Add**.

[![open a database file on your device](images/mssql-16-1024x615.png)](https://blog.jodibooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/mssql-16.png)

4. Browse to the folder where you saved the database export, select **All Files(\*)** and select the database file. Click **OK** twice.

[![browse to the database file](images/mssql-17-1024x607.png)](https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/jodibooks-public-cdn/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/18165025/mssql-17.png)

5. Check if the database name is correct and if so click **OK** to import (restore) the database.

[![check database name and restore](images/mssql-18-1024x599.png)](https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/jodibooks-public-cdn/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/18165318/mssql-18.png)

## App pool credentials

To allow the website (app pool) to connect to and manipulate the database, we have to add it as a database user.

1. In SSMS expand **Security**, **Richt-click** _Logins_ and click **New Login...**

[![add new database login](images/mssql-19-1024x615.png)](https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/jodibooks-public-cdn/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/18170017/mssql-19.png)

2. Type the application pool name `IIS APPPOOL\jodibooks-test` in the _Login name:_ field.

Note 1: You need to have inbound port 445 opened to allow searching for users. I added that in [part 5](../hosting-asp-net-apps-aws-part-5-ec2-instances/). [https://harvarinder.blogspot.com/2019/03/the-program-cannot-open-required-dialog.html](https://harvarinder.blogspot.com/2019/03/the-program-cannot-open-required-dialog.html)

Note 2: to get this to work, I had to login with the Windows EC2 admin credentials first. Then I got a screen where I could search for users. Click the **Object types** button and select **Groups**. After that it works.

[![enter the application name](images/mssql-20-1024x615.png)](https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/jodibooks-public-cdn/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/18172859/mssql-20.png)

3. Now select the **User Mapping** page and select the database `<database>`. Once selected add the roles `db_datareader` and `db_datawriter`. Click the dots in the _Default schema_ column **...** and type `dbo` in the user field. Now click **Check Names** and **OK** twice.

[![configure user mappings](images/mssql-21-1024x616.png)](https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/jodibooks-public-cdn/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/18173822/mssql-21.png)

## Next: SSL

With the database configured, the application should be fully functional. However, we do want to offer secure connections to our website, so in the [next part](../hosting-asp-net-apps-aws-part-12-ssl-certificates-in-iis/) we'll generate our SSL certificate and configure it in IIS.
