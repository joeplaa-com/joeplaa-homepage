Maintaining my staticly hosted React blog was too much of a hassle, so I switched to a self-hosted Ghost blog. I also switched the subject to focus on homelabbing.

**Frameworks**:

* [Ghost](https://ghost.org/)

**Hosting**:

* Self-hosted on a home server with AWS CloudFront, and S3 for storage.
* [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)

**Demo**:
