excerpt: 'What type of website do I need?'
---

There are lots of ways to build a website, but I want to keep it simple and offer three:

1. A static website build with either [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) or [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).
2. A dynamic website based on [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) or a simple [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) blog.
3. A static front-end ([Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) or [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)) with a CMS back-end ([Ghost](https://wordpress.org/), [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/), [Strapi](https://strapi.io/), [WordPress](https://ghost.org/)).

Don't know what you want or need? Try answering these questions:

1. Do I have very specific ideas or wishes about the looks? Take **option 1**.
2. Do I want or need to update texts and images often? Take **option 2**.
3. Actually it's both... Then try **option 3**.
