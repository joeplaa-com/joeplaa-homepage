All terms related to pricing are listed in the [Terms of Service](/conditions/tos). The list below is just a summary and not leading.

1. I generally will ask for a prepayment of 25-50% of the total price.
2. For larger projects (business only), I'll send an invoice with each test version.
3. The payment term is 14 days for businesses (30 days for consumers).
4. Payment can be fulfilled through iDeal or bank transfer.
5. All prices are excluding VAT (21%).
