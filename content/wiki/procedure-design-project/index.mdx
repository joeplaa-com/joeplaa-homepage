excerpt: 'What do I need and what can you expect'

#### 1. Discuss what you want and need

We'll start with discussing what you want and need. For example:
* How many pages do you want?
* What do you want to show?
* How do you want it to look?
* What colors?
* What's your budget?
* Do you have any special needs?
* When do you want the site?

#### 2. Make a proposal

With that information, I'll make a proposal and send out a quotation with an estimated schedule.

#### 3. Get your website data

Before I can start I need the data and images for your website. We will discuss how we can best share it (Dropbox/OneDrive/Email/upload).

I'll also send an invoice with a prepayment for 25%-50% of the total costs, depending on the total amount.

#### 4. Build the first version of your site

After I get approval, received all the data and we agree on the schedule, I'll start with the design of the first version of the website.
Once the first version is done, I'll host the site on a test server. I'll email the address so you can review it whenever it's best for you.

#### 5. Get feedback

This is the time to give feedback on the website. Do you like the colors? Do you want to change or add texts? Do you want to show different images? Etc.

#### 6. Finish your site

With that feedback I'll finish the final version of your website. Again I'll host the site on a test server and email the address so you can review it.

#### 7. Release your site

Once you approve the website, I'll send an invite to the repository on Github<sup>1</sup> or share the data as you like (e.g. Dropbox/OneDrive/Email).

I'll also send out the last invoice for the remaining part of the costs.

1. The repository will stay private.
