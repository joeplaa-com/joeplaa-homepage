#### Static page (€750)

A basic static website will be made with Gatsby.js and consists of:

1. A homepage
2. A portfolio or a blog
3. An info page (contact, address, pricelist)
4. Custom page (whatever else you want to show/share)

If you take this site as an example, it would contain: About, Pricing, Contact and a Portfolio or How-to.

#### Dynamic page (€950)

A basic static website will be made with WordPress and consists of:

1. A homepage
2. A portfolio or a blog
3. An info page (contact, address, pricelist)
4. Custom page (whatever else you want to show/share)
5. Install a [theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/)
6. Setup of admin account and minimal plugins

If you take this site as an example, it would contain: About, Pricing, Contact and a Portfolio or How-to. For plugins I'd install and configure: Akismet Anti-Spam, Autoptimize, Nginx Cache, Redis Object Cache, WPS Hide Login and Yoast SEO.

#### What I don't do

1. I don't design logo's, banners and other brand imaging
2. I don't make or search for images or pictures
3. I don't write the content you want on your website

If you need any of these things, we can of course get a designer and/or text writer involved.
