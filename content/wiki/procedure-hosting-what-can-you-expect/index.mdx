#### Hosting

For hosting your website I'll use AWS services in a region closest to your customers. Currently I can host 2 types of websites:

1. Static websites will be hosted through [AWS CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/).
2. Dynamic websites will be hosted on [AWS LightSail](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/).

Currently I can't host a custom build-time CMS like NetlifyCMS for you. Strapi, however, is possible but at a cost of â‚¬15.00 per month, due to the [server requirements of the admin panel](https://strapi.io/documentation/3.0.0-beta.x/deployment/amazon-aws.html#_3-click-on-the-blue-launch-instance-button).

#### Backups<sup>1</sup>

1. Static website data is not backed up. There is no need as the data is already stored in my Github account, secured with multi-factor authentication.

2. For dynamic websites, I'll make a daily database backup that will be stored for 14 days. After that I will keep one backup per month. The data, like images, will be backed up once a week. I'll keep at least one backup, but depending on the size this might be more (see fair use).

#### Server upgrades<sup>2</sup>

1. If I host a static website for you, updates are not applicable. Updates are only needed if AWS significantly changes their CloudFront service.

2. If I host a dynamic website, I'll run security updates on the OS (Ubuntu) and software once a month. Once every three months I'll do a big update where the server will be restarted. That means your website will be offline for a few minutes, so I'll schedule these updates during the night, limiting inconvenience.

In both cases, whenever a big update or upgrade is needed, I'll let you know 2 weeks in advance.

#### Fair-use<sup>3</sup>

The pricing for hosting is based on a normal website. Normal in this case is a bit hard to specify or quantify and I don't want to make it too complicated. So, when your site is using more resources (bandwidth, storage, processing power, etc.) than what you are fairly paying for, I'll let you know. If this use is structural and/or not corrected, I'm forced to move your site to a bigger server and charge accordingly.

#### Illegal content<sup>4</sup>

I believe in free speech and your website can be about everything you like. There is one but: illegal content is not tolerated. If you upload or place illegal content on your website, I'm forced to shut your website down.
