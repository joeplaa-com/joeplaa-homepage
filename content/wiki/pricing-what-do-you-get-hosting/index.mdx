#### Static page

* Static websites will be hosted through [AWS CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/).
* Every website gets its own SSL certificate from AWS.

#### Dynamic page

* Dynamic websites will be hosted on [AWS LightSail](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/).
* Every website will get its own SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt.
* WordPress and Ghost will be hosted on single instance with a [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) database, [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) web server and [Redis](https://redis.io/) database caching.
* For WordPress I'll use the latest stable version of [PHP](https://www.php.net/), Ghost will run in the latest LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
