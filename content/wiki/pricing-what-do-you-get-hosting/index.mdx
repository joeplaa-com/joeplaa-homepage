#### Domain name (€0.50 p/m + yearly fee)

You can choose to register a domain name yourself or add it to the hosting package. If you choose to let me manage it, it works something like this:

* You choose a domain name or already have one.
* I'll buy or transfer the domain and link it to your website.
* The domain will always be owned by you and can be transfered to your own service anytime.
* The domain name will be charged once a year. The exact fee depends on the top-level domain (.nl, .com, ...) I will invoice it separately.
