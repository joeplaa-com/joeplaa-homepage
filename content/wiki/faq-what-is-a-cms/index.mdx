CMS stands for [Content Management System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system). It is a technique or system to store content. When used for websites, a CMS stores the texts, images, videos, etc. 
All website CMS'es need a computer to run on. They have to actively search all the content for the specific data that needs to be displayed on the current page.

#### Example

Let's use an example to show what is happening behind the screen (no pun intended :)):

1. A user browses to your homepage
2. Your website then needs to show something, so it asks the CMS what data to render/show
3. The CMS fetches the data from files on the server or from a database
4. The data is returned to the CMS
5. The CMS sends the data to the website
6. Your homepage is shown with all text and images.

> User 1--> Website **2--> CMS 3--> Data(base) 4--> CMS 5-->** Website 6--> User

#### Static vs. dynamic

Both static and dynamic websites can use a CMS behind the scenes (the bold text above). The difference is the moment it uses it.

With a static website all the data is fetched when you "build" the website. You press a button or run a command and your computer starts collecting all the data needed to render every page on your website. It then renders and stores every page, which you upload to a hosting platform.

A dynamic website doesn't do this data collection at "build time". Instead you upload all the data and the site to a server. This server then renders each page only when a user needs them.
