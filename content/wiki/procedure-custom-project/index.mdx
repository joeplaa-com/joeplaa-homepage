A custom project basically works the same as a normal design project. There are a few things we do differently though:

1. Our initial discussion (step 1) will be more detailed.
2. We'll make a more detailed schedule (step 2) as it will cost more time.
3. Depending on the size of the project we'll have more test versions and reviews (step 4, 5).
