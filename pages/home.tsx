                                    Joeplaa, pronounce &quot;you-p-laah&quot;, is an abbreviation of my full name: <strong>Joe</strong>p van de <strong>Laa</strong>rschot.
                                    Initially I started using it to shorten my e-mail address, but it turned into my &quot;official&quot; handle @joeplaa everywhere on the web. So obviously I had to use for this website too.

                                    I&apos;m Joep, a {getAge('1985/01/14')} year old guy, trying to figure out what he wants to achieve with his time in the sun*.
                                    Currently I live in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eindhoven' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Eindhoven in The Netherlands</a>, where I went to <a href='https://www.tue.nl/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>university</a> to study mechanical engineering.
                                    After working as a mechanical engineer for 7.5 years, I quit my &quot;dayjob&quot; and started working full time on my own company: <a href='https://www.jodibooks.com' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>jodiBooks</a>.

                                    I&apos;ve originally started joeplaa.com as my personal blog. I wanted to have a place where I could write about anything that I was interested in and you can still find my blog here.

                                    Together with Diana I have a company: <a href='https://www.jodibooks.com' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>jodiBooks</a>.
                                    With this company we try to make administration and technology (software and computers) for beauty specialists as easy as possible.
                                    We developed the jodiBooks software to assists with that, but we also offer to help people out when they need any other help related to administration and technology.

                                    What I learned with jodiBooks is that I really like making websites and web apps. If you want a website and would like me to make it for you, send me an e-mail or message.
                                    You can find examples of my work in my portfolio on this website.

                                    Ever since I bought my first computer, I have been learning how to use it as a server. That was more than 15 year ago. I learned a lot through all those year and now I&apos;m doing it professionally.
                                    In these howto&apos;s I share some of the hurdles I encounter and how I crossed them.
